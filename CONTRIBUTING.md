### How can I contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for this project. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing bug reports as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). If you'd like, you can use [this template](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) to structure your bug report.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined where your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [this template](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md). Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.

- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started the project, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal to start the project, or how you started your virtual environment. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved a file, don't just say "moved a file", but explain **how** you moved it: Did you use the mouse, keyboard or another method? If you moved it with the mouse, did you click and drag or another method?

- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).

- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.

- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
